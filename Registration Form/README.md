You should have to install :
Nodemon, MongoDB, node.js to get the data of Registration form.

To run this :
1. Open the terminal and run "nodemon server.js"
2. Go to mongoDB and then click connect.
3. Then go to chrome and search "localhost:3091"
4. If this port does't work then you can change the port or you can stop the running port "3091" from your task manager.
